# BibTexManager
The purpose of BibTex Manager is to provide a desktop application with a graphical user interface which focuses on ensuring that 
the academic bibliographical information is received from the user and stored properly. BibTex Manager uses ".bib" files to store 
the data and correctly formats the given bibliographical information(entry) according to the entry type chosen by the user. 
BibTex entry type options can be seen by the user when creating a new entry. 
Entries within the ".bib" files, also called BibTex Library, can be edited freely by the user. 
The software allows its users to import bibliographical information from Google Scholar. 
By creating the software we are aiming to help those who have to keep track of all their bibliographical information. 
Every article, book, conference and other entry types that can be seen in the software, can be stored in one place for 
easy entry data manipulation. With BibTex Manager it is easy to upload entries to websites because the software allows 
the user to conveniently export their entries in HTML format.
